# Final-portfolio
This is my final portfolio for Art course 

# [Project 1: Github Poetry Owerview](https://yuliya2002.github.io/Github_poetry/) 
* Do a google search of the last phrase you texted someone. Make sure it is more than one word. If your last text was something like "k" or "lol," check to see what your next-to-last text was, etc.
* Paste the text result into a text editor, and cut and edit that phrase as you like. Don't forget a title.
* Use that same Google search, and download 4 images from the first page of image results. Include them in an "img" folder.
* Use that text and those images to create a flarf poem website. Include an External CSS page to style it any way you like.
* Upload (push) the page to GitHub, and make it available using GitHub pages.

# [Project 2: Green screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77672295/117382568-6a867b80-aea4-11eb-902b-283979babfd3.mp4)
* Using a video editor of your choice, create a video that is 1 minute long
* It must alter our perception of your space in some way, or it must take us to an entirely new space
* You can record the video yourself or you can appropriate video and edit it to make it your own
* You can think at human scale or you can think small (model making?) or huge (space, planets, giants)
* The virtual background must be enabled, and a demo video of it in use recorded using screen capture software.

# [Project 3: Non-linear game: Game_Life-on-the-island](https://yuliya2002.github.io/game_Life-on-the-island/)
* Use the Twine non-linear story platform to create a game.
* Use the Harlowe 3.0.1 format. This is in the settings tab.
* You can use the downloaded or online version. If you use the online version, you will need to save your work by choosing the “Publish to File” option in the settings tab. This will download an .html file that can be opened on any computer.
