* Do a google search of the last phrase you texted someone. Make sure it is more than one word. If your last text was something like "k" or "lol," check to see what your next-to-last text was, etc.
* Paste the text result into a text editor, and cut and edit that phrase as you like. Don't forget a title.
* Use that same Google search, and download 4 images from the first page of image results. Include them in an "img" folder.
* Use that text and those images to create a flarf poem website. Include an External CSS page to style it any way you like.
* Upload (push) the page to GitHub, and make it available using GitHub pages.
